The next thing we can do is to create a list of the squares of the numbers
that we've seen so far, which we can access using square_root().
def square_numbers():
    """Return a list with the squares of the numbers we've seen"""
    list(square_root(square_numbers))

We are now ready to create the following solution to the problem. We will
have to create a function that takes in two integers, and returns the
square root of the first one, and then square the second one. Using this
function, our program will return the following result:

    >>> a = 20
    >>> b = 7
    >>> square_numbers()[0]
    20
    >>> square_numbers()[1]
    15
    >>> square_numbers()[2]
    35
    >>> square_numbers()[0]
    40
    >>> square_numbers()[1]
    32
    >>> square_numbers()[2]
    70

We should then use the following
