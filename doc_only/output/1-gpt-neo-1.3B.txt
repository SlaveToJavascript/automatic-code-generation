I'm trying to check if a string is a palindrome or not. I've tried a few things with no success, can any body point me in the right direction?
P.S: I've read a few posts here on stackoverflow but nothing seems to work.

A:

You can use any of the following:

stringstream::string_compare
std::stringstream::str_compare
vector<int>::difference_type

The code to check whether a string is a palindrome is as follows:
bool isPalindrome(std::stringstream &s)
{
    std::stringstream::iterator iter = s.begin();
    std::stringstream::iterator end = s.end();

    for(;(iter!= end) && ((*iter)!=''); iter++);

    return ((*iter) =='');
}

And the code to check if a string is a palindrome with a vector is as follows:
bool isPalindrome(std::vector<unsigned char> &s)
{
    unsigned char c;
    std::stringstream stream;
    stream.str(c);

    if(stream.good())
