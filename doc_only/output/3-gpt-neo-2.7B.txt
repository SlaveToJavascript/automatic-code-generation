.");
    }

    void main()
    {
        cout << test_square_root_int();
    }

Here's the problem:

    **main.cpp**
    **int main()**
    **{**
    **}**

Here's what's happening: The `test_square_root_int()` function is passed the `int` that is stored in `n` during compilation. That's all. It doesn't work.

The solution:

    void test_square_root_int()
    {
        int n = 3;

        cout << n << endl;
        cout << n << endl;
        cout << n << endl;
        cout << n << endl;
        cout << n << endl;
        cout << n << endl;
        cout << n << endl;
        cout << n << endl;
    }
