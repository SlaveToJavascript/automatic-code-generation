 or odd. However, itâ€™s not clear whether this is an NP-hard problem, which is not surprising given that the problem is defined using integers. Indeed, it turns out that this problem is NP-hard even for 2-connected graphs, which is an interesting fact.

Given a graph and a vertex $v$, the problem is to compute the number of vertices $|V(G_v)|$ that can be mapped to $v$, i.e., $|V(G_v)|$. In this problem, the graph $G$ is assumed to be connected and undirected. The problem is defined as follows:

[**Instance:**]{} A graph $G$ and a vertex $v$.

[**Question:**]{} Does $G$ contain a mapping of $v$ to $1$ or $0$?

[**NP-hardness.**]{} Given a 2-connected graph and a vertex $v$, there is an algorithm that computes the number of vertices $|V(G_v)|$ that can be mapped to vertex $v$, i.e., $|V(G_v)|$.

Let $N_G(v)$ be the set of neighbors of $v$. A [*path*]{} in $G$ is a sequence of vertices $p =
