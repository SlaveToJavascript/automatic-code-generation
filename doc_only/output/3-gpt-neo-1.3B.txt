 with sign

I am having trouble with the following code. I am trying to get the square root of an integer with the sign -1. I'm getting the following error "cannot convert from int to float"" 
int i = 1234;
float fx = (float)i;
float fy = (float)f(i);

I get the following error message when I try to run it.
cannot convert from int to float

A:

float f = (float)(1234);

The function returns a float, not a int.
To convert it to a float, you need to cast it, like so:
float f = (float)(int)f;
